## What is a remote MCP server?

A remote MCP server is an MCP server someone else operates for you. Instead of installing a package and spawning a local process over stdio, you point your client at a URL and authenticate — usually with OAuth.

|  | Local server | Remote server |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Distribution | npm, PyPI, Docker, a binary | a URL |
| Transport | stdio | Streamable HTTP (or legacy SSE) |
| Runs on | your machine | the provider's infrastructure |
| Auth | env vars, config files | OAuth, or an API key |
| Updates | you upgrade | the provider ships |

Everything listed here is a remote server. Entries are only listed after the endpoint answers an MCP `initialize` handshake.

## How to connect

Most clients accept a bare URL. A few examples:

**Claude Code**

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http linear https://mcp.linear.app/mcp
